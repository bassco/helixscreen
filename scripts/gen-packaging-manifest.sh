# gen-packaging-manifest.sh — single source of truth for which source-tree
# directories ship in a HelixScreen package.
#
# Walks the canonical data roots (ui_xml/, assets/, config/) and emits one
# sorted, relative directory path per line. Consumed by:
#
#   - android/app/build.gradle:  writes output to src/main/assets/MANIFEST.txt
#     so android_asset_extractor.cpp can iterate at install time (the Android
#     AAssetDir API can only list files, not subdirectories — the extractor
#     must know the dir tree ahead of time).
#
#   - mk/cross.mk:  (optional) can source this instead of the hand-maintained
#     RELEASE_ASSETS whitelist.
#
#   - tests/unit/test_packaging_manifest.cpp:  regression test asserts this
#     output matches a filesystem walk so new subdirs can't silently drop
#     out of packages (three prior incidents: e0840a4b6, 87452586f, and the
#     Android extractor bug this replaces).
#
# Usage:   scripts/gen-packaging-manifest.sh [PROJECT_ROOT]
# Default PROJECT_ROOT is the parent of this script's directory.
